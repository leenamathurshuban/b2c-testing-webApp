      comment: `This shop is very good both for buying computers and related accessories, and getting any repairs done - they even repair
      The prices here are generally pretty competitive and you will be likely to struggle to find somewhere else that can match both its range of products and prices - I certainly haven't come across such a place.  In addition you get very good customer service and the staff know what they are talking about.  It's well worth a visit especially if you have any repairs that need doing.  I'm no expert on computers, but this does seem to be a good shop.`,

      I brought in my iMac 2017 for upgrade and data recovery.
      They added SSD and recovered my files from the old drive.
      There is a reason why these guys have all these 5 stars on Google and Yelp.
      And they have funny posters and banners ha`,

      comment: `Fast and friendly.  I went in about a week ago because my laptop took a dive on me overnight and I couldn't figure out why.  Unfortunately 99% of my job requires my MacBook  so I was literally dead in the water without it.  I called these guys up and brought my laptop in.  They fixed everything for $95.00 and did so within a 2 hour timeframe.  And they even backed up my all my files without me asking them to.  Saved my day!  Thanks again and all future business I am bringing their way.`,
